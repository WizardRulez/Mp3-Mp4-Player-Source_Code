Hi if Your Here You Where Most Likely At The finished Of This Source Code If Not then This is a source code for a Mp3-Mp4 PLayer But You Probaly already know that
 https://github.com/WizardRulez/Mp3-Mp4-Player
 
 If You Are Going To Make This Your Own You First Need To Download zip then take the folder out of the Zip to start 
 Then I recomend start by going in the Mp3 Folder here And Follow Instructions BUT you are left with all the styleing of them 
 
 If you where told to come back here then you are done to start it go in Index.html
 
 IF You have questions or don't understand something email me at silvallynull4@gmail.com I should answer withen a few minutes to a few days i dont know because i forget to check it a lot If i dont answer after a day then you can spam just dont do i to much
