In here is the html's files For Your Mp3's I will leave the styleing up to you but just copy and paste the "EXAMPlE.html" file # of songs you have then Name them the names of your mp3 you dont have to but it makes it easier

When you have that stuff done Go Into Each Of them and change the stuff to what it says in all caps if your dont have the .Mp3 correct it wont work TIP:It has to be exact if it is uppercase when the name isnt vice verse it wont work

When You Have That Done GO to vide0 next
